# Active Context: Awesome Amazon Q Developer

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initialization phase. The memory bank has been created to establish a clear understanding of the project's purpose, structure, and goals. The "Awesome Amazon Q Developer" repository already contains a well-structured README.md with a curated list of resources related to Amazon Q Developer.

### Recent Activities
- Created memory bank structure
- Analyzed existing README.md content
- Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context

## Recent Changes

The project already has an established structure with the following components:
- README.md with the awesome list content
- Categories for different aspects of Amazon Q Developer
- Resource entries with consistent formatting
- Supporting files like LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.

No changes have been made to the actual awesome list content yet, as we're still in the initialization and documentation phase.

## Next Steps

1. **Content Analysis**: Thoroughly review the existing resources to understand the current coverage and identify potential gaps.

2. **Category Assessment**: Evaluate the current categorization structure to ensure it's intuitive and comprehensive.

3. **Quality Check**: Verify that all existing resources meet quality standards and have functional links.

4. **Contribution Guidelines**: Review or establish clear guidelines for future contributions.

5. **Enhancement Planning**: Identify opportunities to enhance the list with additional high-quality resources.

## Current Challenges
