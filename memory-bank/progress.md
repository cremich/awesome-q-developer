## Current Status

The project is in a **functional state** with a solid foundation:

- The awesome list is established with a comprehensive structure
- Multiple categories cover various aspects of Amazon Q Developer
- Resources are formatted consistently with clear descriptions
- Supporting documentation is in place
- New resources are being added to relevant categories

The memory bank has been initialized to document the project's purpose, structure, and goals, providing a clear foundation for future development and maintenance. Recent additions include:

### February 2025
- A GitHub repository resource in the Diagram To Code section:
  - "From Diagram to Code with Amazon Q Developer - GitHub Repository" - A collection of tutorials demonstrating how to generate diagrams from application code and how to generate code from diagrams using Amazon Q Developer in VS Code.

- Six YouTube video resources across multiple categories:
  - "AWS re:Invent 2024 - Best practices for customizing Amazon Q Developer (DOP217)" in the Amazon Q Developer Customizations section
  - "Accelerate application modernization using generative AI | AWS Developer Day 2025" in the Code Transformation & Modernization section
  - "Building a Generative AI App with Infrastructure as Code powered by Amazon Q Developer" in the Infrastructure as Code section
  - "Supercharge your productivity across the SDLC with generative AI | AWS Developer Day 2025" in the Developer Productivity section
  - "Streamline operational troubleshooting with Amazon Q Developer | AWS Developer Day 2025" in the Operations section
  - "AWS re:Invent 2024 - Streamlining software development across Amazon.com with Amazon Q (AMZ202)" in the Case Studies & Success Stories section

- Four resources in the Infrastructure as Code section:
  - "Q-Bits: Configuring Cross-Account Access with Amazon Q Developer"
  - "Q-Bits: Creating CloudFormation Templates"
  - "Creating S3 Bucket Configurations with CloudFormation using Amazon Q Developer"
  - "Generate Terraform code using Amazon Q Developer"
  
- One resource in the Developer Productivity section:
  - "Generation AI: The age of AI Paired Programming"

- Once resource in the Prompt Engineering section:
  - "Mastering Amazon Q Developer: Part 1 - Crafting Prompts"

These additions strengthen the coverage of CloudFormation, Terraform, cross-account access patterns, application modernization, operational troubleshooting, and provide more video content to balance the resource types. The new case study from Amazon.com also adds valuable enterprise implementation insights.
